# Agile Open Music Patterns
This repository contains Agile Open Music patterns created by the Agile Open Music community.
The idea behind this manual is to make easier the adoption of [Agile practices](https://agilemanifesto.org/) for any musician.

The main purpose for using these practices is helping musicians to improve their skills on music, digital recording but also on how to become a good musician as human being and a good citizen in any kind of community.

We trust in the idea that a musician can't be a real musician if he is not involved in a community goal / effort such as one or more bands, volunteering or digital community.
